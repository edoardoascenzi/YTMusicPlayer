# YTMusicPlayer

### DISCLAIMER! This work is for academic purposes only. I just want to find a job in the software industry, so I am trying to do some projects to learn as much as possible.

### Journal

- The idea is to create a web app that works as a music player using youtube links as records. I will use Django, probably not the best choice, but I just want to learn how to use it.

- The Youtube stream will be performed thorugh a YT API found on RAPID API (https://rapidapi.com/ytjar/api/yt-api). The free plan is limited to 500 request/day, that's okay for my purpose
